Already done
 - One car model.
 - Main menu, with map choosing.
 - Base car physics has been implemented with manual shifting.
 - Base network code.
 - Prepared base nodes for the easier extension. UI element base scripts, car properties, like engine, brake, shift configuration.


TODO
 - Car physics: engine break is missing and too much force wasted in the car rotation
 - Inputs should be reorganized.
 - Networking
