Already done
 - One car model.
 - Main menu, with map choosing.
 - Base car physics has been implemented with manual shifting.
 - Base network code.
 - Prepared base nodes for the easier extension. UI element base scripts, car properties, like engine, brake, shift configuration.
 - The car prepared to use as a moduler way, like engine, break, etc can be changeble.


TODO
 - Car physics: engine break is missing and too much force wasted in the car rotation
 - Car colliders (it has just one box becuase of the testing)
 - Inputs should be reorganized.
 - Networking

# Usage
Download Godot, and open the project -> start it with F5. In the menus choose Singleplayer and you can choose a map. Map selection has been implemented. With the start button, the game will start.
It has only one test map. Shifting up is working with Shift key, shifting down with the Ctrl key.
